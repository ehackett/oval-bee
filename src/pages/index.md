      This is my space to document, and explain to myself, what I have learned
      and any thoughts I need to see written down.




      This site was built using Stackbit, Gatsby and Netlify CMS. I dont profess
      to fully understand everything thats going on behind the curtain here, but
      I hope to learn as I go and eventually make this my own.
